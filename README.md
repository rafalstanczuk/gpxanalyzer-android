ðŸš€ GpxAnalyzer: Advanced GPS Data Analysis on Android â€“ A Showcase of Comprehensive Skills

GpxAnalyzer is not just an application for outdoor enthusiasts, but primarily a **demonstration of comprehensive skills in modern mobile application development**. This project transforms raw GPX data from your adventures â€“ hikes, bike rides, or drives â€“ into engaging visualizations and in-depth analyses.

**Key Competencies Demonstrated in the Project:**

*   **Solid Android Foundation & Modern UI:** The application is built leveraging **Kotlin** and a mature **Android SDK** technology stack. The user interface is implemented using **classic XML Views, Material Components, and ConstraintLayout**, with efficient component access via **ViewBinding/DataBinding**. The use of proven architectural patterns like **MVVM and Clean Architecture**, combined with **Jetpack** components (ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation Component), ensures high code quality, testability, and maintainability.
*   **Advanced Dependency and Data Management:** Implementation of **Hilt** for dependency injection management throughout the project. Effective local data operations are handled by **Jetpack Room**, integrated with **RxJava 2** for reactive database access.
*   **Efficient Asynchronous and Network Operations:** Proficient use of **RxJava 2 (RxAndroid)** for handling complex background tasks, such as **dynamic GPX file searching**, ensuring smooth application performance. Network communication is implemented using **Retrofit and OkHttp**, with **Gson** for JSON data handling.
*   **Specialized GPX and Geospatial Data Processing:** Custom solutions for **precise GPX/XML file parsing** (utilizing standard Android SDK mechanisms). Integration with libraries like **osmdroid** for interactive route visualization on OpenStreetMap maps, and **proj4j** for advanced coordinate system transformations. Utilization of **Joda-Time** for precise date/time operations and **Apache Commons Math** for numerical calculations.
*   **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The project showcases not only deep technical knowledge but also the ability to translate it into **practical solutions that meet user needs** (sports activity analysis), combining programming expertise with an analytical approach to geospatial data.

GpxAnalyzer serves as an excellent example of how a **passion for technology and an active lifestyle** can result in the creation of a tool that delivers real value, while simultaneously acting as a **testament to versatile development skills**. Ideal for detailed on-device activity analysis.
