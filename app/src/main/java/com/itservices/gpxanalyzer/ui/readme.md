# UI Package README

This package is dedicated to the User Interface (UI) of the GpxAnalyzer application. It includes:

*   Fragments and ViewModels (following MVVM)
*   Adapters for RecyclerViews
*   Custom UI components (charts, maps, FABs, etc.)
*   UI-specific mappers and utility classes.

It is organized into sub-packages like `gpxchart`, `storage`, `components`, etc., to manage different UI concerns.

For a detailed description of all UI components, their interactions, and the overall UI architecture, please consult `explanation.md`.
